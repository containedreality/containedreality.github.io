I am not a web developer, so I'm sure the CSS and HTML sucks, I'm surprised I was able to put this together and make it look somewhat good.

Also it's web development, certain websites by multi-billion dollar companies don't even work without JS or will take 3+ seconds to load, so it can't be that bad.

It also works on Firefox 70 which was released in 2017, which is all I care about.
