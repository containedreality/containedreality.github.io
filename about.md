# containedreality

I am containedreality, I am interested in cybersecurity, UNIX, networking, and other similar things.

## Tools

### Operating Systems
* Typically [Xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org/) or [Debian Mate](https://www.debian.org/) (Laptop, VMs, etc)
* [OpenIndiana](https://openindiana.org/) (Server)
* [Microsoft Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11) (Desktop)
* [Kali Linux](https://kali.org/) (Security Lab, CTFs)

### Text Editors
* [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) (rarely anymore, but still sometimes, I do use emacs keybinds as much as possible)
* [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) (almost never outside of servers)
* What ever the operating system comes with typically Notepad or Mousepad.
* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Shells
* CMD or PowerShell
* Any POSIX compatible shell, though I prefer [GNU Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) due to it's customizability and default keybinds.

### Credits
* [containedreality - to my knowledge all of the poor web design](https://github.com/containedreality)
* [GitHub Pages - actually hosting this](https://pages.github.com/)
* [Jekyll - actually making the site function in a reasonable way](https://jekyllrb.com/)
