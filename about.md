# containedreality

I am containedreality, I am interested in cybersecurity, UNIX, networking, and other similar things.

## Tools

### Operating Systems
* [Slackware](http://www.slackware.com/) - Laptop
* [OpenIndiana](https://openindiana.org/) or [OmniOS](https://omnios.org/) - Server
* [Microsoft Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11) - Desktop
* [Kali Linux](https://kali.org/) - Security Lab, CTFs

### Text Editors
* [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) (rarely anymore, but still sometimes, I do use emacs keybinds as much as possible)
* [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) (almost never outside of servers)
* What ever the operating system comes with typically vi, notepad, or mousepad, [ed(1)](https://man.netbsd.org/ed.1).
* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or less commonly [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/).

### Shells
* CMD or PowerShell
* Any POSIX compatible shell, though I prefer [GNU Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) due to it's customizability and default keybinds.

### Credits
